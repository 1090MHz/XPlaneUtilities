# XPlaneUtilities CMake Package Configuration File
#
# This file is only used when XPlaneUtilities is installed system-wide
# (via `cmake --install` with XPLANE_UTILITIES_INSTALL=ON).
#
# NOT NEEDED for submodule usage (add_subdirectory) - which is the default.
# The library is designed to be used as a git submodule without installation.
